There are different types of browsers used today with Chrome , Firefox and Safari making up around 71% of global desktop browser usage.
The main function of a browser is to present the web resource the user chooses, by requesting it from the server and displaying it in the browser window. The resource is usually an HTML document, but may also be an image, PDF, or some other type of content. 
A browser has a UI (user interface) that most commonly includes an address bar, back/forward button, and reload button. When a user navigate to a URL in the address bar one is making a 'request' for the content at that URL. The URL that the user has typed in the address bar maps to an IP address which is called a Domain Name System (DNS). 
Once the browser has the IP address it sends an HTTP request to the web server at that address,and is used to facilitate requests from the browser and responses from the server. 
The browser’s rendering engine is displaying the requested content on your screen as this HTML response is being sent to your browser. 
The browser parses style data (CSS) and together with the HTML it constructs a render tree. Rectangles are then displayed by the render tree (that represent divs, paragraphs, headlines, etc.) with a few visual attributes such as color and size dimensions. 
The rectangles are displayed in order of the page. The contents are then positioned in the way they will appear in the browser. 
The last step is “painting” where the elements are drawn on the screen. The browser will send a request to the web server to get files like link tags and img tags as the browser Is rendering.
